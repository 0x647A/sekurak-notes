# My Sekurak Learning Notebook

This repository is a collection of scripts, exercises, and solutions I've crafted while following various Sekurak courses, tackling CTF challenges, and jotting down notes. Think of it as my digital *notebook* - a place where I experiment, learn, and document cool stuff related to cybersecurity, programming, and beyond.

## Why this repo?

I treat this space like my coding *workbench*:  

- **Testing snippets** inspired by Sekurak tutorials  
- **Solving CTF challenges** and related tasks  
- Writing **notes and utilities** for everyday learning  
- Keeping track of **certificates and milestones** earned on this journey (coming soon!)  

It's informal, raw, and evolving — basically, my personal lab where I get my hands dirty and grow as a developer and security enthusiast.

## What's inside?

You'll find a mix of Python scripts and other code, covering topics like:

- File system scanning and performance comparisons  
- Code line counters and HTML report generators  
- Language detection tools  
- Directory monitoring via polling and event-driven watchers  
- Fun API fetchers (advice, activities, dog pictures)  
- Simple APIs built with FastAPI  
- Multiprocessing and threading demos  
- Password cracking and hash reversing attempts  
- CRC32 collision experiments (part of a fun CTF!)  
- A broken file fixer using remote hash verification secured by Proof-of-Work  
- Markdown-to-ANSI converters for cool terminal outputs  
- A polite web crawler searching for flags on CTF challenge sites  

... and many more little projects and exercises that come up on the path of learning.

## How to use this repo?

Feel free to browse, study, run, or even fork the scripts!  

Most scripts stand alone and come with their own `README.md` sections explaining what they do. If you want to try them yourself, you’ll usually just need Python 3 and some common libraries (e.g., `requests`, `fastapi`, `watchdog`).  

I often use AI tools, official documentation, and resources from the internet when writing and improving the code, combining them with my own understanding to create better solutions.

I'm always open to suggestions, collaborations, or sharing insights — so if you want to connect, ping me!

## What’s next?

- Adding my **Sekurak course certificates** here as proof of progress  
- Expanding the notes and utilities with new things I learn  
- Polishing some scripts into neat, re-usable tools  
- Sharing tips and tricks I've picked up along the way
